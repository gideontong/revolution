# Revolution

Revolution is a video game downloader and organizer for the Nintendo Wii, Nintendo vWii and emulators like Dolphin Emulator. It can also tag GameCube games for the purposes of running in the Dolphin Emulator. If this package cannot yet, that is because the feature is planned. Revolution is named after the Nintendo Wii, whose codename was Codename Revolution prior to the original release of the Wii.

You can use this Python package by importing it into `pip` (planned).
